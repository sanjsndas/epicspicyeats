            <p class="text-lg text-charcoal-black leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This section covers various general legal provisions that apply to these Terms.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal-black mb-3">14.1. Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-charcoal-black leading-relaxed mb-4">
                These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by EpicSpicyEats on the Services, constitute the entire agreement between you and EpicSpicyEats concerning the Services. They supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between you and EpicSpicyEats with respect to the Services.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal-black mb-3">14.2. Severability</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-charcoal-black leading-relaxed mb-4">
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.

            <p class="text-lg text-charcoal-black leading-relaxed mb-4">
                No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and EpicSpicyEats' failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal-black mb-3">14.4. Assignment</h3>

            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal-black mb-3">14.5. Headings</h3>

            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal-black mb-3">14.7. Relationship of the Parties</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-charcoal-black leading-relaxed mb-4">
                You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and EpicSpicyEats as a result of these Terms or your use of the Services.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal-black mb-3">14.8. Feedback and Suggestions</h3>
