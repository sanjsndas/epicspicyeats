                Our Services may contain links to websites, applications, or services operated by third parties that are not owned or controlled by EpicSpicyEats. These third-party links are provided for your convenience and information. For example, we may link to external sites for ingredient suppliers, cooking equipment, or other culinary resources.

Similarly, if you interact with our content on social media platforms, your interaction is governed by the privacy policies of those platforms.
