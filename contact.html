                    <p class="text-smoke-gray">
                        A: Many recipes include tips for adjusting heat. Generally, you can reduce the amount of chili peppers or chili powder for less heat, or add more for an extra kick. Dairy products (like yogurt or sour cream) and acidic ingredients (like lime juice or vinegar) can help to balance or reduce spiciness. Refer to our <a href="index.html#cooking-tips" class="text-flame-orange hover:underline">Cooking Tips & Heat Balancing Guides</a> for more detailed advice on managing heat.

                    <p class="text-smoke-gray">
                        A: Many of our recipes include notes or suggestions for dietary adaptations. While we strive to offer diverse options, not all recipes are inherently suitable for every dietary need. We recommend carefully reviewing the ingredient lists and making necessary substitutions based on your requirements. We are continuously working to expand our collection of recipes to cater to a wider range of dietary preferences.
